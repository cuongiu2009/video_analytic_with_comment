# Feature Specification: Sentimental Analysis for a specific video

**Feature Branch**: `001-c-users-lenovo`  
**Created**: 2025-09-23 
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Instead of analyzing a general topic, the application will focus on analyzing a specific video provided by the user via URL. The goal is to provide a detailed 'emotion report', comparing the content of the video with the community's reaction through comments."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   → If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   → Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   → Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   → If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   → Each requirement must be testable
   → Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   → If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   → If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## Clarifications
### Session 2025-09-23
- Q: Which video platforms should the system initially support for analysis? → A: YouTube only.
- Q: Which languages should the system initially support for video content analysis (speech-to-text)? → A: Both English and Vietnamese.
- Q: What is the expected maximum number of comments per video to be analyzed? → A: As many as the API allows.
- Q: How should the system visually indicate an error (e.g., invalid URL, API failure) to the user? → A: Inline message next to the input field.
- Q: What is the target maximum time for a complete analysis (from URL submission to report display)? → A: 1 minute.
- Q: What should the system display in the report if a video has no comments? → A: Show a message "No comments found" and omit all comment-related sections (chart, word cloud, etc.).
- Q: If the AI fails to understand the video's content (e.g., no discernible speech or objects), how should this be reflected in the report? → A: Omit the video content summary section and add a note: "Video content could not be analyzed."
- Q: What is the desired strategy if the TikTok API rate limit is hit while fetching comments? → A: Stop fetching, analyze the comments collected so far, and add a warning to the report: "Comment list is incomplete due to API limits."
- Q: How should the system indicate that an analysis is in progress after the user submits a URL? → A: Disable the input field and "Analyze" button, and display a spinning loader icon next to them.
- Q: What level of logging is required for the analysis process? → A: Detailed: Log each major step (e.g., "Fetching comments", "Analyzing sentiment", "Generating report") and include performance timings.
- Q: What is the expected maximum video length for analysis? → A: 3 minutes
- Q: What is the expected output format for the sentiment report? → A: JSON
- Q: What specific "associated insights" are expected in the sentiment report beyond overall sentiment, score, and keywords? → A: Topic-specific sentiment
- Q: What is the preferred notification mechanism for analysis completion? → A: UI Notification
- Q: What is the desired strategy for handling external API rate limits? → A: Display a persistent, dismissible toast notification to the user.

## ⚡ Quick Guidelines
- ✅ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ❌ Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- 👥 Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a user, I want to provide a video URL and get a detailed sentiment analysis report, comparing the video's content with the community's reaction in the comments. I also want the ability to skip the video content analysis for videos without speech, so I can focus only on the comments.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a user provides a valid video URL from a supported platform with content analysis enabled, **When** they submit the URL, **Then** the system should start the full analysis process.
2. **Given** a full analysis is complete, **When** the user views the report, **Then** they should see a summary of the video content, a sentiment analysis chart of the comments, a conclusion comparing the content and comments, and a word cloud of key topics from the comments.
3. **Given** a user provides a valid video URL but disables content analysis, **When** the analysis is complete, **Then** the report MUST only display the sentiment analysis of the comments (chart, word cloud, etc.).
4. **Given** a user provides an invalid URL, **When** they submit it, **Then** the system should show an error message.

### Edge Cases
- If a video has no comments, the report MUST display a message "No comments found" and omit all comment-related sections (chart, word cloud, etc.).
- If the AI fails to analyze the video's content, the report MUST omit the content summary and include a note: "Video content could not be analyzed."
    - If the YouTube API rate limit is hit, the system MUST analyze the comments retrieved so far and add a warning to the report that the comment list is incomplete.- If a URL from an unsupported platform is provided, the system MUST show an error message: "Unsupported platform. Only YouTube URLs are accepted."
- **Error Handling**: Invalid URLs or API failures should be indicated via an inline message next to the input field.
- If external API rate limits are encountered, the system MUST notify the user.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST accept a video URL as input from the user.
- **FR-002**: System MUST be able to extract the main content of the video, which may include:
    - Speech-to-text transcription.
    - Image/frame analysis to identify key objects, scenes, or actions relevant to the video's primary subject or narrative.
    - Generating a concise, 2-3 sentence summary of the video's content and message, focusing on key themes.
- **FR-003**: System MUST be able to collect a large number of comments for the given video URL.
- **FR-004**: System MUST perform sentiment analysis (positive, negative, neutral) on each collected comment.
- **FR-005**: System MUST generate a report that includes:
    - A summary of the video content.
    - A pie chart showing the percentage of positive/negative/neutral comments.
    - A concise, 1-2 sentence conclusion comparing the overall sentiment of the video's content with the overall sentiment of its comments, highlighting any significant discrepancies.
    - A word cloud or list of the top 10 most frequently mentioned keywords (single words or short phrases) in the comments, excluding common stop words.
- **FR-008**: System MUST identify key topics within the comments and provide sentiment analysis for each identified topic.
- **FR-006**: System MUST support videos from YouTube only.
- **FR-007**: System MUST handle videos in English and Vietnamese.

### User Interaction
- **UI-001**: While an analysis is in progress, the system MUST disable the URL input field and submission button.
- **UI-002**: While an analysis is in progress, the system MUST display a loading indicator (e.g., a spinner) near the input field.
- **UI-003**: Upon completion of analysis, the system MUST notify the user via a UI Notification.

   Non-Functional Quality Attributes:
   - **Performance**: Target maximum analysis time is 1 minute (from URL submission to report display).
   - **Observability**: The system MUST log each major analysis step (fetching, sentiment analysis, report generation) with performance timings.

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Video**: Represents the video being analyzed. Attributes: URL, content summary, derived sentiment.
- **Comment**: Represents a user comment on the video. Attributes: text, analyzed sentiment (positive, negative, neutral).
### 3.4 Lifecycle/State Transitions

-   Video status transitions: PENDING -> PROCESSING -> COMPLETED / FAILED.

### 3.5 Data Volume / Scale Assumptions

-   Maximum video length for analysis: 3 minutes.

### 6.2 Failure Modes

-   External service outages should be handled gracefully (e.g., retries, informative error messages).

### 6.3 Data Import/Export Formats

-   Sentiment report output format: JSON.
