# Implementation Plan: Sentimental Analysis for a specific video

**Branch**: `001-c-users-lenovo` | **Date**: 2025-09-23 | **Spec**: [spec.md](spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/001-c-users-lenovo/spec.md`

## Execution Flow (/plan command scope)
```
1. Load feature spec from Input path
   → If not found: ERROR "No feature spec at {path}"
2. Fill Technical Context (scan for NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
   → Detect Project Type from context (web=frontend+backend, mobile=app+api)
   → Set Structure Decision based on project type
3. Fill the Constitution Check section based on the content of the constitution document.
4. Evaluate Constitution Check section below
   → If violations exist: Document in Complexity Tracking
   → If no justification possible: ERROR "Simplify approach first"
   → Update Progress Tracking: Initial Constitution Check
5. Execute Phase 0 → research.md
   → If NEEDS CLARIFICATION remain: ERROR "Resolve unknowns"
6. Execute Phase 1 → contracts, data-model.md, quickstart.md, agent-specific template file (e.g., `CLAUDE.md` for Claude Code, `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for GitHub Copilot, `GEMINI.md` for Gemini CLI, `QWEN.md` for Qwen Code or `AGENTS.md` for opencode).
7. Re-evaluate Constitution Check section
   → If new violations: Refactor design, return to Phase 1
8. Plan Phase 2 → Describe task generation approach (DO NOT create tasks.md)
9. STOP - Ready for /tasks command
```

## Summary
This plan outlines the implementation of a video sentiment analysis tool. It will take a YouTube video URL, perform speech-to-text transcription, and analyze the sentiment of both the video content and the comments. The technical approach is to create a Python-based application that uses specialized libraries for interacting with YouTube, performing sentiment analysis for English and Vietnamese, and transcribing audio.

## Technical Context
**Language/Version**: Python 3.11+
**Primary Dependencies**: 
- **YouTube Scraping**: `yt-dlp`
- **Sentiment Analysis (EN)**: `vaderSentiment`
- **Sentiment Analysis (VN)**: `underthesea`
- **Speech-to-Text**: `openai-whisper`
- **Web Framework/API**: `FastAPI`
**Storage**: N/A (processing is in-memory/on-demand)
**Testing**: `pytest`
**Target Platform**: OS-independent (Python application)
**Project Type**: Single project
**Performance Goals**: Complete analysis within 1 minute.
**Constraints**: Must support English and Vietnamese.
**Scale/Scope**: Handle as many comments as the YouTube API/yt-dlp allows.

## Constitution Check
*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

- **Library-First**: The core logic will be developed as a self-contained library. (PASS)
- **CLI Interface**: The library will expose its functionality via a CLI. (PASS)
- **Test-First**: TDD will be used for development. (PASS)

**Structure Decision**: Option 1: Single project

## Phase 0: Outline & Research
1. **Extract unknowns from Technical Context**: All initial unknowns (libraries for scraping, sentiment analysis, speech-to-text) have been resolved.
2. **Generate and dispatch research agents**: Research has been completed.
3. **Consolidate findings**: Findings are consolidated in `research.md`.

**Output**: `research.md` with all NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved.

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts
*Prerequisites: research.md complete*

1. **Extract entities from feature spec** → `data-model.md`
2. **Generate API contracts** from functional requirements → `/contracts/`
3. **Generate contract tests** from contracts.
4. **Extract test scenarios** from user stories → `quickstart.md`
5. **Update agent file incrementally**

**Output**: `data-model.md`, `/contracts/*`, failing tests, `quickstart.md`, agent-specific file.

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach
*This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan*

**Task Generation Strategy**:
- Generate tasks from Phase 1 design documents. Each API endpoint will have a corresponding contract test and implementation task. Each data model will have a creation task. User stories will be translated into integration tests.

**Ordering Strategy**:
- TDD order: Tests will be created before implementation.
- Dependency order: Data models will be created first, then services, then the API.

## Progress Tracking
*This checklist is updated during execution flow*

**Phase Status**:
- [x] Phase 0: Research complete (/plan command)
- [x] Phase 1: Design complete (/plan command)
- [x] Phase 2: Task planning complete (/plan command - describe approach only)
- [x] Phase 3: Tasks generated (/tasks command)
- [x] Phase 4: Implementation complete
- [x] Phase 5: Validation passed

**Gate Status**:
- [x] Initial Constitution Check: PASS
- [x] Post-Design Constitution Check: PASS
- [x] All NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved
- [ ] Complexity deviations documented: N/A
